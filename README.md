# Good, Cheap, Fast Checkboxes

https://thedanitor.github.io/checkboxes/

This project is from the Day 32 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have added some comments to the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what particular lines of code do.

### Overall Impression

Cool to see how simple it is to make those sliders that I see everywhere. Also a good reinforcement of how to use checkbox logic for interactivity.
